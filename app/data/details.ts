    instructions: "INSTRUCTIONS",
    instructDetails: "Begin by rinsing and patting dry a whole chicken. Combine minced garlic, olive oil, dried thyme, rosemary, salt, and pepper in a bowl to create a marinade. Place the chicken in a zip-top bag or dish, pour the marinade over it, add sliced lemons, and massage to ensure even coating. Marinate for at least 2 hours, ideally overnight, in the refrigerator. Preheat your grill to medium-high heat. Grill the chicken skin-side down for 15-20 minutes, then flip and grill for another 20-25 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 165°F. Remove the chicken from the grill and let it rest for 10-15 minutes before carving and serving to allow the juices to redistribute. This recipe provides a basic framework, and you can customize it by adding a splash of white wine or lemon juice to the marinade for extra tanginess, stuffing the cavity with aromatics, or roasting the chicken in the oven if grilling is not an option.",
